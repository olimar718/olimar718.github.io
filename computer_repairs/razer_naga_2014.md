# Swapping cable with dell mouse
# weird behavior of the cable with usb cord extender
- I plug in the mouse in a usb port it doesn't work (dead, no light)
Using the same usb port on the pc I put a usb cord extender in between the mouse and the pc it works (WTF!!). NOW I REMOVE THE USB CORD EXTENDER FROM THE PORT,
I USE THE PORT DIRECTLY AND IT WORKS !!!!!! AS IF THE PORT WAS "CONTAMINATED" TO WORK BY THE CORD EXTENDER WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Need to test a y cable
